### What I learned

This was my first time using an API and I found it relatively easy after watching a lot of videos. I opted to use [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), which makes things a lot easier.

### Continued development

I will continue to do more projects that use an API for added practice and learning.

### Useful resources

- [Axios Documentation](https://github.com/axios/axios) - This is the Axios documentation.
